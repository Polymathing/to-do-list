# to-do-list

• I like to stay on track and have clarity on what I have to do on a daily basis, so I've decided to create this intuitive and easy to use online Todo list. It helps you to get organized, simplify your life, and to get things done. It focuses heavily on the UI aspect of the app with great visual clarity.

• You can create your own list tab just by creating a path in the url with your name (e.g "https://todolist-polymathing.herokuapp.com/YourName").
